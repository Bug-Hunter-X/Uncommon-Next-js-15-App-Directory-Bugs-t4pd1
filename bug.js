In Next.js 15, issues can arise from the interaction between the `app` directory's features (like RSC, streaming, and data fetching) and third-party libraries or custom code that isn't fully compatible.  For example, a library might make assumptions about how rendering happens that are violated in the `app` directory, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.  Another common problem is improper use of `async/await` within `async` components, potentially causing race conditions or data inconsistencies.  Incorrect handling of loading states and error boundaries can also cause unexpected behavior.
